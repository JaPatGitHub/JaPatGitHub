### Hey there üëã Smile please üòÅ

I'm a 15-year-old in high school. Damn passionate about building things that solve people's problems. Hence currently trying to solve my problem - using technology to transform education.  

I'm currently learning JavaScript with a focus on creative coding and physics simulations in [p5.js](https://p5js.org). I also know some python. I plan to further extend my skills in  web development & data science/ML.

I'm an open-source enthusiast and currently contribute to [Exercism](https://exercism.org). 
Here at [SimulatingEdu](https://github.com/JaPatGitHub/SimulatingEdu), I am using p5.js to create interactive educational animations. Obviously open-sourced!

I'm new to software development and would love to have connections with anyone. So, feel free to [email](mailto:japrad26@gmail.com) me or [DM](https://twitter.com/jyotir1221) me on Twitter! Would be glad to talk to you!!
