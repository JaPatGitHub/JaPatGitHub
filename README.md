### Hey there 👋 Smile please 😁

I'm a 15-year-old in high school. Damn passionate about building things that solve people's problems. My current interests lie in using technology to transform education.  

I'm currently learning JavaScript with a focus on creative coding and physics simulations in p5.js. I plan to further extend my skills in backend web development.

I'm an open-source enthusiast and currently contribute to [Exercism](https://exercism.org). Here at [SimulatingEdu](https://github.com/JaPatGitHub/SimulatingEdu), I am using p5.js to create interactive educational animations. Obviously open-sourced!

I'm new to software development and would love to have connections with anyone. So, please feel free to email me or DM me on Twitter! Would be glad to talk to you!!
